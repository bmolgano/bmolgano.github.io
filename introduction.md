# Introduction

Mental health is a critical public health priority that affects people of all ages, backgrounds, and communities. In Colorado, access to mental health services is especially important as the state continues to experience population growth, demographic shifts, and federal and state budget fluctuations. With new residents arriving every year and existing communities evolving, ensuring that behavioral health services are available, accessible, and affordable becomes an ongoing challenge. This isn’t just about providing support for those currently seeking care, it’s also about planning ahead to meet future needs. Colorado’s policymakers, health systems, and community organizations all face questions about where to place new mental health clinics, how many providers will be needed, and which regions may experience service gaps. Understanding these future needs requires a proactive approach that looks beyond today’s numbers. This project focuses on exploring how Colorado’s projected population growth can be used as a foundation for predicting future mental health service demand across the state. By examining long-term population trends and age breakdowns, we can better anticipate where services will be most needed, helping to guide planning, resource allocation, and policy development.

This project explores how population growth and demographic changes in Colorado over the next 20 to 30 years could shape the future demand for mental health services. It centers on the idea that projected population shifts among high-need age groups can serve as early indicators of where service capacity may fall short. This research aims to bring a proactive lens to an already strained system. It matters because current capacity doesn’t always reflect future need, especially in fast-growing or underserved areas. While several studies and public health strategies have aimed to increase access to care, few have connected those efforts directly to projected population data at the county or regional level. This project offers a framework for using state population projections to anticipate demand and eventually combining those insights with additional datasets to deepen the analysis. Ultimately, this work is about helping local leaders, providers, and policymakers better align services with the communities they serve.

# Research Questions 
1.	Which Colorado counties are projected to experience the highest population growth between 2025 and 2055?
2.	How is the age distribution expected to change across Colorado regions over the next 20–30 years?
3.	What percentage of projected population growth in Colorado is among adults aged 18–64 versus those aged 65 and older?
4.	How might these demographic shifts correlate with future mental health service demand by region?
5.	Which Colorado counties currently face mental health provider shortages, and how might that overlap with projected population growth?
6.	Are there specific age groups driving the largest increases in projected service demand?
7.	What policies or programs are already in place to address projected mental health service needs across Colorado?
8.	How do rural and urban counties compare in terms of both projected population growth and existing mental health resources?
9.	What gaps exist in the current data that make it harder to forecast mental health service demand?
10.	How can predictive modeling help mental health organizations and policymakers plan for future needs more effectively?
